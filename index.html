      <h2>Welcome to ICACIE 2023</h2>
      <img src="Images/header.jpg" alt="Header" width="100%" height="128">
      <p>ICACIE 2022 focuses on both theory and applications in the broad areas of advanced computing and intelligent engineering. ICACIE is a multidisciplinary conference organized with the objective of bringing together academicians, scientists, researchers from industry, research scholars, and students working in all areas of advanced computing and intelligent engineering. The conference will provide the authors and listeners with opportunities for national and international collaboration and networking among universities and institutions from India and abroad for promoting research and developing technologies.</p>

      <h2>Keynotes/Invited Speakers</h2>
      <img src="Images/speaker.jpg" alt="Header" width="100%" height="128">
      <p>Consensus protocol analysis suffers from unrealistic instantaneous information communication assumptions. To address this, we shall consider arbitrarily large delays in consensus protocols and explore its impact on the dynamical behavior of convergence. We formulate a conjecture about the emergence of slowly oscillating periodic (SOP) orbits as delay becomes significant from sine-like waves to square waves.Further, dynamical stability behavior of (i) minimally connected multi-agent configuration, i.e., a chain, (ii) fully connected graph, and finally the intermediate configuration, (iii) multiple agents connected in a circular fashion with exactly one full length closed path will be reported. It will be shown that for chain configuration, period-doubling behavior will be observed irrespective of the number of agents. For a fully connected network configuration guaranteed and stable convergence to consensus point with equal contributions from all agents, i.e., peer-setup will be proved irrespective of delay and number of agents.</p>
