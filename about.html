    <h2>Université des mascareignes (UdM)</h2>
    <p>Université des Mascareignes (UdM) is the fourth public university in Mauritius. This new tertiary institution in under the aegis of the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2012 after a merger between the IST (Institut Supérieur de Technologie) of Rose-Hill and Swami Dayanand Institute of Management (SDIM) of Pamplemousses, the ‘Université Des Mascareignes’ (UdM) has some 1,100 students that are currently enrolled in various courses.

    <p>In any part of the world, higher education is an opportunity: a collective opportunity for the progress of the economy, the societies and the territories, and also an individual chance for one to acquire knowledge and ethical values based on a harmonious personal and professional development. It is this opportunity that the Université des Mascareignes aims to bring to its students at large.The Université des Mascareignes is a young University – with a strong proven partnership with the Université de Limoges (France).  This joint venture permeates at different levels – whether it be at pedagogical, research, governance or administrative levels.  Although only incepted as University in 2012, the Université des Mascareignes is increasingly distinguishing itself in the Higher Education landscape.</p>
    <p>This triangular base is a successful formula for students of the Université des Mascareignes; they become bilingual, by mastering two essential languages for their career and obtain two certificates (Mauritian and French) with competences on the lookout in the job-market.The Université des Mascareignes has a dual ambition. Anchored in its territory, it is a socially responsible university that intends to contribute to the economic, cultural and social development of the island and its population by offering training and research in areas connected with development strategy of Mauritius: whether it be in Engineering, Banking and Finance, Sustainable Development, etc. But the Université des Mascareignes has an outreach well beyond its borders, within the Indian Ocean and Southern Africa.  This is achieved through international academic or research partnerships and projects with foreign universities, focused on environmental and societal specificities of the Indian Ocean islands.</p>
